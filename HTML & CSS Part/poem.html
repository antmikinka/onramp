	<p>
    If a person holds oneself dear,  <br />
    let one watch oneself carefully.  <br />
    The wise should be watchful  <br />
    during at least one of the three watches.  <br />
	</p>
    Let each person first direct oneself to what is right;  <br />
    then let one teach others; thus the wise will not suffer.  <br />
    If a person makes oneself as one teaches others to be,  <br />
    then being well-controlled, that one might guide others,  <br />
    since self-control is difficult.  <br />
	<p>
    Self is the master of self;  <br />
    who else could be the master?  <br />
    With self well-controlled  <br />
    a person finds a master such as few can find.  <br />
	</p>
    The wrong done by oneself, born of oneself,   <br />
    produced by oneself, crushes the fool,  <br />
    just as a diamond breaks even a precious stone.   <br />
    The one whose vice is great brings oneself down   <br />
    to that condition where one's enemy wishes one to be,  <br />
    just as a creeper overpowers the entangled sala tree.  <br />
    Bad actions and actions harmful to ourselves are easy to do;  <br />
    what is beneficial and good, that is very difficult to do.  <br />
	<p>
    The fool who scorns the teaching of the saintly,  <br />
    the noble, and the virtuous, and follows wrong ideas, <br />
    bears fruit to one's own destruction, <br />
    like the fruits of the katthaka reed. <br />
	</p>
    By oneself is wrong done; by oneself one suffers; <br />
    by oneself is wrong left undone; by oneself is one purified.  <br />
    Purity and impurity come from oneself;  <br />
    no one can purify another.  <br />
    <p>
    Let no one neglect one's own duty <br />
    for the sake of another's, however great; <br />
    let a person after one has discerned one's own duty,  <br />
    be always attentive to this duty. <br />
	</p>
	Gautama Budda.  <br />
